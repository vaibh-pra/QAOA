Algorithms pertaining to QAOA

Here I will regularly upload QUBO(Qudratic Uniconstrained Binary Optimization) problems, solving them with QAOA(Quantum Aprroximate Optimization Algorithms).
These problems cover a vast number of problems in industries related to logistics, pharmaceuticals, finance, AI etc. Efficient solutions of QUBO problems
could lead to possible monetary gains for respective industries.
You will find that the QAOA algorithms here use minimal library functions from Qiskit. Instead they are built from scratch and are hence more flexible and much easy to troubleshoot.
