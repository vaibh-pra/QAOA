Algorithms pertaining to QAOA

Here I will regularly upload QUBO(Qudratic Uniconstrained Binary Optimization) problems, solving them with QAOA(Quantum Aprroximate Optimization Algorithms).
QUBO problems encapsulate a vast number of problems generated in industries linked to logistics, pharmaceuticals, finance, AI etc. Efficiently finding their solutions 
could lead to possible monetary gains for these industries.
You will find that these algorithms use minimal library functions from Qiskit. Instead the QAOA algorithm is built from scratch. Hence it is more flexible and much easy to troubleshoot.
