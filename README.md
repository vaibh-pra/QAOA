Algorithms pertaining to QAOA

Here I will regularly upload QUBO(Qudratic Binary Uniconstrained Optimization) problems, solving them with QAOA(Quantum Aprroximate Optimization Algorithms).
QUBO problems encapsulate a vast amount of problems generated in industries linked to logistics, pharmaceuticals, finance, AI etc. Efficiently finding their solutions 
could lead to possible monetary gains for these industries.
